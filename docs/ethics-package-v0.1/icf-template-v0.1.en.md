Date: 2026-02-24
Status: template for local site adaptation

## 1) Study Description

You are invited to participate in a research study comparing voiding parameters
measured by a standard clinical uroflowmeter with parameters estimated by an
iPhone-based application.

## 2) What Will Happen

- You will complete a standard free-flow uroflow test according to routine clinic practice.
- An iPhone recording will be collected in parallel (audio, bowl-area video, motion sensors).
- The application will generate measured parameters and recording quality indicators.

## 3) Data Collected

- Technical recording data (time series, signal features, quality flags).
- Calculated parameters (`Qmax`, `Qavg`, `Vvoid`, timing metrics, etc.).
- Reference clinical measurements (standard uroflowmeter output).

Optional (separate consent only):
- storage of raw audio/video for research validation.

## 4) Risks and Inconvenience

- Possible discomfort related to the recording procedure and waiting time.
- Confidentiality risk, mitigated through technical and organizational controls.

## 5) Potential Benefit

There may be no direct medical benefit to you.
Study results may improve future urinary monitoring methods for other patients.

## 6) Confidentiality

- Data are pseudonymized (participant names replaced with study codes).
- Access is restricted to authorized study personnel.
- Storage duration and deletion policy follow the approved site protocol.

## 7) Voluntary Participation

- Participation is voluntary.
- You may refuse or withdraw at any time without impact on your medical care.

## 8) Contacts

- Study site: __________________________________________
- Principal investigator: ________________________________
- Study contact: _______________________________________

## 9) Consent Statement

I confirm that I:
- read and understood the information;
- had an opportunity to ask questions;
- voluntarily agree to participate.

Participant name: _____________________   Signature: __________   Date: __________
