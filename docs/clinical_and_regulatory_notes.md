# Clinical and Regulatory Notes (Draft)

This repository is for research and prototyping only.

Before any real-world medical use, the product will require:

1. Clinical validation against reference uroflowmetry devices.
2. Risk management process (for example ISO 14971).
3. Software lifecycle and quality management controls (for example IEC 62304).
4. Data privacy compliance (HIPAA/GDPR/local law depending on jurisdiction).
5. Medical device classification and regulatory clearance.

No diagnostic claims should be made until formal validation and approval are complete.
